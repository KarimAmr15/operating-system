## Overview
Developed a simulation project to emulate core functionalities of an operating system, focusing on **process scheduling** and **memory management**. This project demonstrates the principles of multitasking, resource allocation, and efficient execution of processes, providing insights into the inner workings of an OS.

## Key Features
- **Process Scheduling:**  
  - Implemented **Round Robin (RR)** and **Shortest Job First (SJF)** algorithms to handle multitasking and optimize CPU utilization.  
  - Designed a mechanism to manage context switching, ensuring fair distribution of CPU time among processes.  

- **Memory Management:**  
  - Simulated dynamic memory allocation techniques, including paging and segmentation.  
  - Integrated memory tracking to monitor allocation, deallocation, and fragmentation.  

- **Program Simulation:**  
  - Developed functionality to parse and execute programs described in text files, supporting:  
    - Variable declarations and assignments.  
    - Arithmetic computations.  
    - File I/O operations for reading and writing.  
    - Output commands to display results and logs.  

- **Execution Monitoring:**  
  - Used a console interface to visualize:  
    - The currently executing process.  
    - Completion status of all processes after each scheduling cycle.  
  - Detailed logs for memory utilization, process execution, and I/O operations.  

## Technical Highlights
- **Language:** Java  
- **Algorithms:** Round Robin, Shortest Job First  
- **Modular Design:** Clean separation of process scheduling and memory management modules for flexibility and scalability.  
- **Error Handling:** Integrated robust error-handling mechanisms to prevent crashes during invalid file operations or process inputs.
